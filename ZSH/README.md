Install:

* Zsh : `brew install zsh`
* [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
* Install 'Hack Nerd Font' but keep powerlevel9k mode in ZSHRC to awesome-fontconfig
* In terminal preferences, change terminal font to 'Hack Nerd'

After that, copy `.zshrc` and `.zpreztorc` from `.zprezto/runcoms`.
This should work out, but I have included the whole `.zprezto` directory, just in case.
